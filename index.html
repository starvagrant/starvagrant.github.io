<p>Turning Hack Nights to Projects. Coders code, and the best coders collaborate. In teaching myself to program, there's always been one thing that's frustrating. I can't find an open source project to work on. The programs I love to use? They're already so complicated I'll never figure out their internals. And searching for something small through github? It doesn't look to promising. But plenty of cities have meetups, ala Meetup.com, the do have regular hack nights. What if that could make it's way into a repository to work on at a later date. Currently, I'm looking of doing something specific for the KC PHP Users Group, but a good test case could lead to something more general.

<p>Away with foo and bar!! Yes the venerable first two variables of tradition have to go. I propose replace it with blarg tut, because it sounds funnier. This is a repo for me to fiddle with the mechanics of git and github. Don't expect to much by way of code here.

<p>Bad habits mean crappy productivity. Crappy productivity means more work and less fun. Here's a little habit program for keeping track. Currently it works on my local machine.

<a id="open-rpg" class="anchor" href="#open-rpg" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Rpg</h3>

<p>Coders love games. Nothing gets the mind ready for real life like simulated life, provided you wanted to actually live. In this repo I take on two challenges: one, an rpg tracking system for tabletop games (quite in it's infancy) and a card game in the works called Super PAC, where players get to enjoy all the fun of political scheming without the banal cheerleading of real electoral politics.
